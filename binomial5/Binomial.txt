Language: BASIC
Calculators: 
TI-83+ and TI-83 
(possibly for any calculators but just haven't tested it on all.)

Info: 
(Note: this program fixes a flaw in "Binomial Expansion" (83) and the
file is much smaller) This program expands binomials that are in the
form (ax + by)^c. Does binomials with exponents up to and including 15.
Also all you have to do is push a button at the end to repeat [,]
the program or end [)] the program.
