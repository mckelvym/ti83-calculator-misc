This is just like the classic "Space Invaders" game.
Use the left and right arrow keys to move.
Press enter to fire.
If you hit the space invader, then you go onto the next level.
But if he reaches the bottom of the screen, then you lose.

(It is exactly the same as my 1st Invaders, but NOW WITH LEVELS!)

Thank you for downloading INVADERS v2.0.  Have Fun!
