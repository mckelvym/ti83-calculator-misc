
Mental Math Practice, Version 1
By Eric B. Gray  ericbgray@att.net

Instructions are included in the program, but it is very easy to use.  The only non strait-forward aspect of this proram is that with the devision problems, your answer must only be within 1 number of the answer for it to be correct.
I have tested it thoroughly, but if any bugs are found please email them to me at the above address.

I hope you find this program to be helpful.  I practice with it often, and I am a math tutor at school.
