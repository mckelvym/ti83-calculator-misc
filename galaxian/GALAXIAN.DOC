----- I. INTRODUCTION -------------------------------------------------------

    Galaxian is a small shoot-em-up game for the TI-83(+) calculator.  In order
to completely take advantage of the calculator's capabilities, it is written
in Z80 assembly language for the ION assembly shell (version 1.1 or
greater).

    Included in this zip file are two different versions of the game. One
with basic controls and one with the classic controls from the 85 version.
The classic controls are in Galaxian.83p. The basic controls are galaxan2.83p.

    The goal in this game is simple.  You have a small ship and your goal is
to destroy evil aliens without getting destroyed yourself.  You can destroy
them by firing dispruptor blasts at them.  You can attempt to prevent your
own destruction by moving out of the path of the enemy's shots.

----- IV. THE STORY OF GALAXIAN ---------------------------------------------

    An alien civilization knows as the Galaxians developed on the planet
Galaxia, which is approximately 80 light-years away from Earth.  Many years
ago (around 800 C.E. by Earth's calendar), there was great unrest on
Galaxia.  Many citizens of Galaxia were strongly displeased with their
government, inevitably leading to violent rebellion.  Due to its massive
strength, the Galaxian government managed to subdue most of its opponents.

    However, one particulary extreme group of rebels managed to elude the
government forces.  They called themselves the Rutmi-Gani-Salver, which
roughly translates to "The People's Voice Party."  They believed that the
government had to be taken down by whatever means were necessary.  After
several years of bombings and assassinations which accomplished little,
they decided to unleash biological weapons against the capital city of
Galaxia.

    The deadly germs spread far more than they expected, killing more than
95% of the Galaxians within two weeks.  Since there were no resources to
treat the widespread disease, there was no hope for survival.  A few
Galaxians managed to escape by leaving the planet in spacecraft bound for
distant planets.  Since Galaxian technology at that time was not advanced
enough for long-range space travel, most of the craft did not make it.
However, a few of them did.

    The first Galaxian scout ship reached Earth's solar system and entered
orbit around our sun in 1975 C.E.  They managed to learn a great deal
about the inhabitants of Earth from its radio and television broadcasts.
Within 20 years, they had deciphered several Earth languages.

    The first team of Galaxians landed on Earth on February 20, 1998 C.E.,
in the southeastern part of the nation then known as the United States.
Since they wore detailed costumes to make them look exactly like humans
and could speak English, the nativese of Earth couldn't tell any difference
between them and true humans.

    Over the next few years, they gradually gained increasing influence on
Earth.  By the year 2003 C.E., they had established de facto control over
all major countries on Earth.  In 2005 C.E., they united all nations of
Earth under one government which was secretly controlled by the Galaxians.

    Shortly thereafter, several Galaxian ships carrying tens of thousands
of refugees approached the Earth.  Exactly as they had planned, Earth was
under complete control by the time they had arrived.  They now were ready
to land on Earth and enslave its population.

    But it would not be that easy.  Several group formed on Earth to oppose
them.  The majority of Earth people were completely fooled by the Galaxian-
controlled pupper government, and they fought to destroy virtually all of
the resistance.  Most of those who realized what was going on had no power
to do anything to about it.

    You are now the only surviving resistance fighter on Earth.  The year
is now 2008 C.E., and alien invasion is imminent.  You are in control of a
highly advanced prototype spacecraft, armed with sophisticated weapons and
an experimental auto-regeneration system.  You are the only hope to defend
the Earth from alien conquest.  Succeed, and you will guarantee the freedom
of the people of Earth for years to come.  Fail, and you will have turned
over the Earth to alien invasion.  The whole planet is counting on you!

----- V. ENEMY TYPES --------------------------------------------------------

#....#     These drones are probably the first enemies you will encounter 
#....#  in your quest.  Such enemies are not very dangerous since they can
######  only drop conventional bombs and are easily destroyed.  You should
######  be aware that these drones (as well as more advanced ones) may 
.####.  swoop down in attempts ram your ship.  They will occassionally
..##..  accompany fleets of more advanced craft.


#....#     This type of drone is slightly more dangerous than the first.
##..##  Their armament is just as limited as the previous drones, but they
######  possess energy shielding which allows them to withstand substantial
#....#  firepower without being destroyed.
#....#
.#..#.
..##..

#....#     This type of drone uses similar technology to the previous one.
######  The only difference is a new type of engine which generates the same
#....#  amount of power in less space.  Since the craft is smaller and
.#..#.  lighter, less energy needs to be used for propulsion and thus more
..##..  can be used for the energy shields.

#.....#     These are the most advanced drones you will encounter in
##...##  Galaxian.  Due to more advanced shielding, it will often take four
#.#.#.#  shots from your cannon to destroy them.  They are, however, still
#..#..#  completely vulnerable to lasers.
#.....#

##...##     This is a somewhat strange enemy.  The cross ships were meant
###.###  as trainers for beginning pilots.  However, they do carry live
.#####.  bombs on training missions, so they may sometimes be sent to 
..###..  attack you when you approach them.  Since the pilots of these craft
.#####.  are not very experienced, they will fly eratically and sometimes
###.###  the pilots will be frightened and leave the battle.  In order to
##...##  protect the pilots from themselves, they are well armored.

.#####.     These craft are light fighters.  They are manufactured and
#######  piloted by humans, primarily former telephone compnay employees,
##...##  who went to work for the Galaxian military after their former jobs 
##...##  were declared illegal by the Anti-Communications Act of 2006.
##...##  They have rotating cannons which fire directly towars your ship,
#######  and have advanced energy shielding.  They are among the more
.#####.  dangerous enemies you will encounter.

#..............#     These two types of heavy fighters are   ################
##............##  very similar in capabilities.  They are    ###..........###
#.############.#  armed with two cannons which makes them    ###..........###
#......##......#  farily dangerous.  They also carry a lot   ###..........###
#......##......#  of armor.  They also possess optical       ###..........###
.#.....##.....#.  deflectors which make them completely      ####........####
..#....##....#..  invulnerable to lasers.  Fortunately,      ###.#......#.###
...##########...  you will only meet a few of them.          .#...######...#.

   The most dangerous enemy in Galaxian is the ATTACK CRUISER.  These are the
ships which carry the alien invaders down to the Earth's surface.  Because of
this, they are heavily armed and heavily armored.  They typically possess
four cannons, are capable of absorbing more than 90 cannon shots, and are
completely invulnerable to lasers.  In addition to this, these ships are
also capable of manufacturing and deploying drones during combat.  Because
the ATTACK CRUISERS are the backbone of the Galaxian invasion, the Galaxians
will be much more willing to reach a peaceful settlement after you have
destroyed a couple of these.

----- VII. INTERNAL INFORMATION ---------------------------------------------

   This section is not nearly finished yet.  It's also in almost as bad of a
mess as the actual Galaxian source code (hard to believe, but true).  Enjoy!

         Section 1 : Variable Layout
The game stores variables in three areas.  The first is at $8265.
In there, all of the game statistics like enemy positions, enemy strengths,
enemy types, bullet positions, etc. is stored.  This is what is backed up
when the game is saved.  In addition,some information is stored in the program itself.
The saved game data is also saved in the Galaxian string.

         Section 2 : Level Loading
Unlike the ugly kludge used in versions 2.02 and earlier, Galaxian 3.0
bases its level loading on a table of offsets.  This is a jump table which
contains relative pointers to code which initializes levels.  When the
routines in this jump table (levels_jump_table) are executed, they load
the DELc memory with the static data for that level, and return a pointer
to the routine which sets up the positions in text memory.  If the routine
was called to enter a level, the set-up routine would then be called.  It
would not be called if you had just resumed a saved game already on the
level, since that data changes constantly and must be saved in the string
whenever the game is saved.

         Section 3 : What the main loop does
Step 1 : Enter next level if no enemies remain
Step 2 : Clear temporary display buffer in graph memory
Step 3 : Fire appropriate weapon if 2nd or Alpha was clicked
Step 4 : Move (or explode) your ship and draw your ship
Step 5 : Move your bullets and draw them
Step 6 : Cause enemies to begin swooping down if appropriate
Step 7 : Move all normal enemies and draw them
Step 8 : Detect collisions between enemy ships and you
Step 9 : Move large enemy and draw it (if there is one)
Step 10 : Cause large enemy to fire periodically (if there is one)
Step 11 : Cause normal enemies to fire
Step 12 : Move enemy bullets, draw them, check for collisions with your ship
Step 13 : Copy temporary buffer to display memory
Step 14 : Handle miscellaneous keys
Step 15 : Start over!

         Section 4 : Vital statistics
Frame rate : Approximately 35 frames per second (varies quite a bit)
Maximum number of enemies : 21
Maximum number of player's bullets : 10
Maximum number of enemy bullets : 10
Number of levels : 20

----- XI. THE FUTURE OF GALAXIAN ---------------------------------------------

NOTE: THIS IS SAID BY PATRICK DAVIDSON REFERRING TO THE 85 VERSION!
   The next version (3.1) will probably be released soon after this one.
It depends on whether or not I get any good ideas for it or happen to find
any bugs.  After that, I plan to release a version 4.0 which will be much
more complex than this one.  Certain enemies will drop coins when you
destroy them.  You will be able to collect these coins and use them to buy
things like extra lives, new weapons, or better ships.  After that, I
probably won't do anything more with Galaxian but there is a possibility of
even more much later, such as multi-player capabilities.
