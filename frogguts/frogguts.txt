If you find any bugs that make levels impossible to beat by all means email 
me and tell me immediately!!!


Version 1.0:
	Ported to the 83 (+)
	Missing High Score
 	~300 bytes less than 82 version


This is version 1.1 of FrAWGutS (formerly frogguts) for the ti-83 calculator.
It will work perfectly under ION
as well. 
The game is the file frogguts.83p (or .8xp) and takes up about 2.4k. The assembler
source code is also included. (frogguts.z80)
				
The game is your basic frogger clone of dodging cars and getting to the 
other side of the screen.  You control your frog by using the arrow keys
on your calc.  Enter will continue at any text or score screen. Mode will 
quit the game but only during the game (Enter quits anywhere else).
You cannot quit from the title screen. Enter also pauses the game which
shows the number of the level you are on. 

The bottom half of the screen is a highway with cars
zooming by. Watch out or you will be squished by one of them causing you to
lose a life. The top half of the screen is a sewer with deadly currents.
Lily pads and giant rotten logs float continuously through the sludge.
You must jump from lily pad to log to survive. You will drown if you fall in 
the water. The very top of each level is your goal. You also have a timer
which counts down very quickly. As you progress through the game the 
time you have to complete each level decreases rapidly. Be on the look
out for butterflies also. They appear every so often and if eaten will give
you some extra points. 
 
You must guide your frog to one of the blank places at the top of the
screen to win. If you try to enter an occupied space 
you will die.  When you get six frogs to their goal you will progress to 
the next level. The levels get harder as you go with there being more
traffic on the roads, less logs and lily pads in the water, much faster
speeds, and less time to complete the level. There are twelve levels in 
the game right now and there might be more later if I can find some beta
testers!  
  
High scores are saved as well. When you achieve a high score you can now
type in your initials to be saved. Just type them in using the letter
keys on your calculator (left key backspaces. Pressing mode at the high
score screen will save your score under the name typed in when the last
high score was achieved. Press enter when you're done typing your initials.
  
You score 10 points for jumping up a row
and 460 points for making it to the other side. You score 200 points for
catching a butterfly. You have five lives and
you must get six frogs to their goal to beat the level (notice that there
are six goals). You are awarded an extra life every 8000 points. 

I suggest you play the game at lower contrast on your calculator because 
the frog is too hard to see on the back of a log or lily pad when the 
contrast is too dark. 

About the Program:

There is a secret in the game that you should be able to find 
if you are observant. 

Yes, I included the slighltly improved source code again. 
I've included it mainly because I think that the source should be included
with every ti game and because I hope that someone might port the game to 
other calcs/shells (I only have an 82).
I realize that the code is ugly, probably has
some mistakes in it and is not commented very well but it works. 
Just don't expect to learn assembler from it. I'm a beginner myself still.

Thanks goes out to:  
All the people I borrowed code from, the creator of the online Ash assembler
course, Evil Sam for testing the game and finding bugs and making good
suggestions, Amy and Alyssa for playing the demo version and saying they 
liked it, Tex Avery, Vic Chesnutt, Late Night Black and White,
and Ilya Winham.

SPECIAL THANKS TO FLORENT D for fixing the bug!
Thanks to Quija13, Deluce, and Bryan R. for beta testing.

The colecovision emulator ColEmWin and the coleco frogger game were 
invaluable to the creation of this game.
