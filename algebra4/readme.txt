I know there are alot of people out there that need help in Algebra and Geometry so i write this program to help them out and also to help me. This program currently does Circle Arc Length, Circle Area, Circle Circumference, Circle Sector Area, Regular Polygon Area, Sphere Surface Area, Sphere Volume, Triangle Area, and The Pythagorean Theroum.
If you can think of anything else that would fit good with this program email me at keesy1882@yahoo.com with any ideas. Please have Algebra Program as your subject.
